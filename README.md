# gaming-save-file-locations.yml
A list of save-file-locations for various games. The list is will be using common variables used in the [PC Gaming Wiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/)
These are just the save file locations that I discover through my own games. Any help to complete and maintain it is always welcome!

## Common placeholders (Linux)
This list is a little help in case someone wants to resolve paths, using a WINE environment.
- %LOCALAPPDATA% = $WINE_PREFIX/drive_c/users/$USER/AppData/Local
